http://loinc.org,3.1.0,active,"2.16.840.1.113883.6.1",LOINC,Logical Observation Identifiers, Names and Codes (LOINC),"LOINC provides a set of universal names and ID codes for identifying laboratory and clinical test results.1,2 LOINC facilitates the exchange and pooling of results, such as blood hemoglobin, serum potassium, or vital signs, for clinical care, outcomes management, and research. LOINC's universal identifiers (names and codes) can be used in the context of order and observation exchanges between information systems that use syntax standards such as HL73, CEN TC251, ISO TC215, ASTM4, and DICOM. Specifically, the identifier can be used as the coded value for an observation in any other standard that uses the observation/observation value paradigm, whether messages, documents, application programming interface (API), etc. For example, LOINC codes are used widely in the OBX segment Observation Identifier field (OBX-3) of an ORU HL7 (HL7 version 2.x or ASTM 1238-9410) message that may be sent between a Clinical Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and Electronic Health Record Systems (EHR).5, 6 In this way, LOINC codes provide universal identifiers that allow the exchange of clinical data between heterogeneous computing environments.","ValueSet/document-classcodes"

http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ActCode,9.0.0,active,"2.16.840.1.113883.5.4",ActCode,ActCode,"A code specifying the particular kind of Act that the Act-instance represents within its class.    *Constraints:* The kind of Act (e.g. physical examination, serum potassium, inpatient encounter, charge financial transaction, etc.) is specified with a code from one of several, typically external, coding systems. The coding system will depend on the class of Act, such as LOINC for observations, etc.    Conceptually, the Act.code must be a specialization of the Act.classCode. This is why the structure of ActClass domain should be reflected in the superstructure of the ActCode domain and then individual codes or externally referenced vocabularies subordinated under these domains that reflect the ActClass structure.    Act.classCode and Act.code are not modifiers of each other but the Act.code concept should really imply the Act.classCode concept. For a negative example, it is not appropriate to use an Act.code ""potassium"" together with and Act.classCode for ""laboratory observation"" to somehow mean ""potassium laboratory observation"" and then use the same Act.code for ""potassium"" together with Act.classCode for ""medication"" to mean ""substitution of potassium"". This mutually modifying use of Act.code and Act.classCode is not permitted.","ValueSet/v3-ActCode"
